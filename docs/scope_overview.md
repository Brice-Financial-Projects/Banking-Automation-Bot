# Project Scope & Overview: Automated Personal Finance Sync Bot

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Modern consumers face ongoing challenges in maintaining up-to-date and organized personal finances across multiple bank accounts.

**Pain Points:**
- Manual download and categorization of transactions is time-consuming and error-prone.
- Not all budget apps support every bank, and most require paid subscriptions for basic features.
- Delays in receiving meaningful insights can lead to missed payments and poor spending awareness.

---

## 2. High-Level Solution Overview

The **Automated Personal Finance Sync Bot** is a Python 3.12 application designed to securely connect to users’ bank accounts (using the Plaid Sandbox API), automate transaction retrieval, and deliver timely, actionable financial summaries.

**Key Features:**
- **Automates retrieval** of account transactions and balances.
- **Automatically categorizes** expenses and income.
- **Generates and delivers summary reports** (weekly spending, category breakdowns, trend analysis).
- **Maintains robust data security** using production-level best practices.

## 3. Data Storage, Security, and Delivery Model

To ensure a professional, secure, and scalable solution, the app will adopt an industry-standard SaaS architecture for storing and delivering financial data:

- **Cloud-Hosted Database:**  
  All user and transaction data will be securely stored in a cloud database (such as AWS RDS or Heroku Postgres). This supports persistent storage, historical analysis, and multi-user functionality.

- **Web App Delivery:**  
  Users will access their reports and dashboards through a secure Django web application, requiring authentication to view sensitive information.  
  Reports (including PDFs and interactive charts) will be available for download directly from the dashboard, never as email attachments.

- **Automated Notifications:**  
  Users will receive automated email notifications when a new report is available. Emails will contain a secure link to the web app—no sensitive data or attachments are ever sent via email.

- **Security Best Practices:**  
  All data in transit and at rest is protected using modern encryption and secure authentication methods.
  Credentials, API keys, and tokens are managed via environment variables and never stored in code.
  The app follows privacy-first and compliance-aware principles, mirroring real-world fintech data handling.

**Why This Approach?**  
This architecture:
- Mirrors real-world fintech and SaaS platforms, demonstrating full-stack engineering skills.
- Enables persistent storage, historical insights, and scalable user management.
- Maximizes both security and professionalism—key signals for recruiters and technical interviewers.

## 4. Development Approach: MVP and Production Upgrade

**Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with Streamlit**
- **Goal:** Rapid prototyping and instant feedback.
- **Approach:**  
  - Use Streamlit to quickly visualize, interact with, and demo the core automation pipeline.
  - Focus on getting Plaid Sandbox integration, transaction retrieval, basic categorization, and reporting live ASAP.
  - Share an interactive dashboard for early demo purposes and recruiter/interviewer walkthroughs.

**Phase 2: Upgrade to Django for Production-Level Web App**
- **Goal:** Professional, scalable, and portfolio-ready solution.
- **Approach:**  
  - Rebuild or extend the Streamlit MVP in Django for a full-featured web application.
  - Implement persistent user authentication, advanced reporting, enhanced UI, and potential multi-user support.
  - Leverage Django’s robust ecosystem for database management, templating, and deployment best practices.
  - Provide a “see how I iterate and productionize” story in your portfolio, emphasizing both rapid prototyping and real-world readiness.

## 5. High-Level Implementation Steps

1. **API Integration**
   - Securely connect to the Plaid Sandbox API using best practices for auth and token management.
2. **Data Retrieval & Parsing**
   - Fetch and normalize transaction and balance data.
3. **Automated Categorization**
   - Apply rule-based or ML-powered categorization of transactions.
4. **Reporting & Notification**
   - Generate summary reports and display via Streamlit (MVP) and Django dashboard (production).
   - Implement secure user notification by email with login links.
5. **Scheduling & Automation**
   - Implement scheduled data pulls and reporting (e.g., using APScheduler, cron, or Django’s management commands).
6. **Security & Compliance**
   - Use environment variables (`.env` files) and secrets management for all sensitive credentials and tokens.
   - Document all security best practices.
7. **Demo & Documentation**
   - Provide both Streamlit MVP and Django app walkthroughs.
   - Include detailed setup, usage, and security instructions in the GitHub repo.

## 8. Demo Plan

- **MVP Demo:**  
  - Interactive Streamlit dashboard showing account linking (via Plaid Sandbox), transaction sync, categorization, and reporting.
  - Designed for fast feedback, recruiter demos, and interview walkthroughs.

- **Production Demo:**  
  - Django web app with user authentication, persistent data storage, advanced reporting, and a polished UI.
  - “Step up” from the MVP, showing full-stack web development and deployment skills.

- **Both versions** will be documented and included in the public GitHub repository, with clear setup instructions and security notes for reviewers.
